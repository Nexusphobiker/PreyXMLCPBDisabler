# PreyXMLCPBDisabler
Needs update for current prey version!

Disables the save XMLCPB format for Prey 2017

Usage:

- Start the program 
- Start Prey
- All saves created during this session will be in the standard XML format
- You will be able to load and save savegames without the XMLCPB format

ATTENTION: DONT TRY TO LOAD ONE OF THE SAVES WITH XMLCPB ENABLED. THE GAME WILL THINK IT IS CORRUPTED AND DELETE IT. (Or just backup your savegames)
